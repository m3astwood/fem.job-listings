# Frontend Mentor Challenge : Static Job Listing

Submission for [Frontend Mentor Static Job List] challenge. Written using [VueJS] and [Pinia] Vue store. 

A constant challenge I have is knowing when to put functionality in the store or on the parent component. Probably wasn't necessary to use Pinia in this project, but I enjoyed the practice.
